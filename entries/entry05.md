# Entry 5: Actual work with **_SASS_**

So, I will start building the website during my week 5 entry. I have spent this week
really just planning and thinking about what my website is going to be.
<br> <br> I decided that I will throw it back a little to junior year and I will make my project an extension of the SHABR project we did last year.
I spent time brainstorming what changes I want to do to the project, and I ended up with the following list


<li>Add Sass (Obviously)
<li>Change the content, make the website a real estate company: <br>
Literally, have all the content different but same layout. Name the company PYB
 Real Estate. Literally, I will go out and take actual pictures of places to put on the slide show. It's going to be amazing.
 
 Anyways, you get the idea of the content.
 Now, the SASS part isn't going to be hard at all; I can't wait to start next week.
 I will incorporate the following things:  <br>
 <li>Partials
 <li>Mixins
 <li>Operators
 
 ## Takeaways:
 1) Don't rush into the project. I did that in the past and I feel like that really made the work 
 feel harder; now, that I have done a little basic planning on this Sass project
  I really do feel kind of better!
