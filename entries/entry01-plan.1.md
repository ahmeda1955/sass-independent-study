# Entry 1: Intro / Plan

### Why did I decide to research SASS?

I was always a huge fan of web-design. If I had to pick my favorite unit of **SEP** (Software Engineering Program), I'd probably pick
web design. I loved and enjoyed every second of the web design unit, building websites was fun to me. 
I liked seeing the  cool effects **CSS** had on the plain **HTML** websites and the different possibilities it gave me other than having a plain, old looking website.
Now, learning that I could elaborate on **CSS** and make it more creative was really interesting to me.
