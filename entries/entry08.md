# Entry 7: Wrapping stuff up

## So, I am able to fully engage with SASS now and everything I type is real-time incorporated into
 the code.
 I have already tweaked some parts of the website with SASS, I was able to use Variable and Partials to fulfill my CSS needs.
 
 #I came to a realization that SASS doesn't really ADD into css functions. To explain, SASS just makes CSS, way more efficient
  but that doesn't necessary mean it adds on to it. In my opinion, at least.
  
  To explain, variables, in SASS; what do they do? They hold on to values like font, color, and 
  stuff that is already included in CSS. So, realistically SASS would be helpful in really big project where efficiency is a necessity.
  
  I came to that realization while I was incorporating Sass into my CSS.
  
  
  ##Takeaways
  1) Slacking is the worst thing ever. Don't slack on your topic because you might forget stuff and then you'll waste time having to learn it and go over it 
  again while you could be using time efficiently, learning something different.
